# Platformio configuration hints for ESPHome components
# Place this in your ESPHome root directory or add to platformio.ini

# The MLX90632 component requires Adafruit BusIO library
# This should be automatically handled by ESPHome's external component system

# If you get compilation errors about missing Adafruit_BusIO_Register.h:
# 1. Ensure ESPHome is using platformio (not manual compilation)
# 2. The external_components configuration should trigger library download
# 3. Check that you have internet connectivity during the build
# 4. Try deleting .pio directory and rebuilding

# Example platformio.ini extension (if manual configuration needed):
[env]
lib_deps = 
    adafruit/Adafruit BusIO @ ^1.14.1
